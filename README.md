# About this project

This is a simple demo project of RocketBlog built using ReactJS and TypeScript.<br/><br/>

The project layout was developed by Rocketseat, and it is on Rocketseat Discover.<br/>
I decided to do this project to train a little bit about creating layout using Styled-Components with React.<br/>
I started making the project with ViteJS. So... it's very simple to install the project.<br/><br/>
That's all, folks. ‚ù§
